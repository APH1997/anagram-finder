## anagram-finder


An anagram is defined as a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "cinema", formed from "iceman".  Given a word, create an anagram finder that returns an array of all of the possible anagrams for that word, not including itself.  If no anagrams exist, return an empty array.

The anagrams you find much be valid English workd.  An open source Scrabble dictionary is provided in this repo to confirm the anagrams found are actually real words.

Feel free to preprocess the dictionary however you see fit to optimize your solution. All words in the dictionary are lowercase.  There is a skeleton file and a basic solution tester included.  I realize you could just clone this repo and access the dictionary with Ruby file I/O, but it is ever so slightly more challenging if you have to download the dictionary instead of opening it.  However, either solution type is accepted by the basic tester. :)

Here's the link if you choose to download it:

I'll push my solution for critique on Monday or so...
