## anagram-finder
Given a word, create an anagram finder that returns all of the possible anagrams for that word, not including itself.  If no anagrams exit, return an empty array.

First you will need to download a dictionary to ensure that your anagrams are actual word.  A link to a open source Scrabble dictionary will be provided to confirm the anagrams you find are actually real words. All words in the dictionary will be lowercase.

Without giving too many hints, it is advisable to preprocess that dictionary how you see fit to optimize your solution, andthe dictionary actually starts on line 3 of the file.
