## anagram-finder


An anagram is defined as a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "cinema", formed from "iceman".  Given a word, create an anagram finder that returns an array of all of the possible anagrams for that word, not including itself.  If no anagrams exist, return an empty array.

First you will need to download a dictionary to ensure that your anagrams are actual words.  A link to a open source Scrabble dictionary is provided below confirm the anagrams you find are actually real words.

Feel free to preprocess that dictionary how you see fit to optimize your solution. All words in the dictionary are lowercase.
